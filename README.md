# Mailbox Prototype
CodePath iOS for Designers: Week Three

Only spent about 5 hours this week as been doing a ton of technical investigation / experimentation with Parse for our group project!

All the required tasks plus panning from edge and shake to undo (used in demo to return message to original state).
